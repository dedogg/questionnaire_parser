This project covered one of my work tasks. 

I had about 60 developers surveys with data about skills and levels of different topics, and I needed to analyze them. 

Algorithm:
- Parse all the data to PostgreDB
- Give weight to every answer
- Count final weight for each topic and total weight for every programmer
- Compare results and salaries for different developers
